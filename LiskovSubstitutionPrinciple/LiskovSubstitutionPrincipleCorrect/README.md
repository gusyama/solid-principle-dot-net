# Liskov Substitution Principle

## Good Design

In the improved design, both Rectangle and Square extend Shape, and each provides its own implementation of getArea without violating the expected behavior of the superclass or each other. They are substitutable for each other as instances of Shape, adhering to LSP.

Conclusion:
By adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle, developers ensure that subclasses enhance rather than contradict the behavior of their superclasses. This principle supports polymorphism and encourages a hierarchical structure that is both intuitive and maintainable, contributing to the overall robustness and flexibility of object-oriented systems.
