# Open/Closed Principle

The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design, formulated by Bertrand Meyer. It emphasizes that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. 

## Open for Extension
This aspect of the principle suggests that the behavior of a module or class can be extended to accommodate new requirements or changes in functionality. In practical terms, this means that you should be able to add new features or functionality to a system without altering the existing codebase.

## Closed for Modification
This aspect stresses that once a module or class has been written and tested, its implementation should be closed for any modifications. In other words, the existing code should remain untouched and should not require changes to meet new requirements or to fix bugs. Instead of modifying existing code, the focus should be on extending it through new code.

## Why is the Open/Closed Principle Important?

### Maintainability
By adhering to the OCP, you minimize the risk of introducing new bugs or unintended side effects in existing, well-tested code.

### Scalability
It promotes scalable software design because you can add new features by writing new code rather than changing existing code. This keeps the system more stable and easier to manage over time.

### Testing and Validation
When a module is closed for modification, its behavior becomes predictable, making it easier to write comprehensive tests and validate the correctness of its functionality.

## Applying the Open/Closed Principle

### Abstraction
Use abstract classes, interfaces, or inheritance to define a stable core that can be extended by subclasses or implementing classes.

### Design Patterns
Utilize design patterns such as Strategy Pattern, Template Method Pattern, or Factory Pattern to separate the stable parts of the system from the parts that are likely to change.

### Dependency Injection
Inject dependencies into your classes rather than hard-coding them, allowing for easier replacement and extension of behavior without modifying the class itself.
