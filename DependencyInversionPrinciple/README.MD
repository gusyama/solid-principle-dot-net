# Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the five principles in the SOLID design principles for object-oriented software development. It was introduced by Robert C. Martin and focuses on reducing the coupling between modules and promoting a more flexible and maintainable architecture.

## Key Concepts
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

This means that classes should depend on interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations.

Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.

Abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) define a contract or set of methods that concrete implementations must fulfill. Concrete classes should implement these abstractions rather than the other way around.

## Why is DIP important?
Reduced coupling: By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, modules become more independent of each other. This reduces the risk of changes in one module causing widespread changes in other modules.

Flexibility and extensibility: When modules depend on abstractions, it becomes easier to replace or extend implementations without modifying existing code that relies on those abstractions. This is particularly useful in large and complex systems where requirements change frequently.
